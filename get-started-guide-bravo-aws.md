## Set up host machine

To establish a serial connection between your host machine and the *Bravo AWS IoT ExpressLink*, you must install the USB to UART Bridge Virtual Communication Port drivers. You can download these drivers from [Telit IoT developer Resources - USB Drivers](https://www.telit.com/evkevb-drivers/). For more information, see the driver user guide included in the zip archive. 
Open a terminal application for your host machine (e.g., TeraTerm for Windows, CoolTerm for Mac) and select the port corresponding to the evaluation kit. Configure the terminal application as follows:
| Parameter        | value         |
| -----------------|---------------|
| Baudrate:        | 115,200       |
| Bits:            | 8             |
| Parity:          | None          |
| Stop:            | 1             |
| Flow control:    | None          |
| Local Echo:      | Yes           |

For a quick check, in the terminal window type: `AT` followed by `<return>`. If you receive the answer `OK`, Congratulations! You have successfully connected the evaluation kit to your host machine.

### Mobile Network Operator specific configurations
The Bravo LE910C1-WWXD is a worldwide module capable of connecting to a comprehensive range of Mobile Network Operators (MNO).

However, some MNOs require special configuration for the module to properly work on their network.
